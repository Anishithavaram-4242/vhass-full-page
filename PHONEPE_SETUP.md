# PhonePe Payment Gateway Setup

## ðŸš€ PhonePe Integration Complete!

I've successfully integrated PhonePe payment gateway into your VHASS platform. Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## ðŸ“‹ Required Credentials

You need to provide these PhonePe credentials to complete the integration:

### 1. **Merchant Key**
- Get this from your PhonePe merchant dashboard
- Replace `YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY` in the code

### 2. **Salt Key**
- Get this from your PhonePe merchant dashboard
- Replace `YOUR_SALT_KEY` in the code

### 3. **Salt Index**
- Usually `1` (default)
- Replace `1` if different

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with these variables:

```env
# PhonePe Payment Gateway Configuration
REACT_APP_PHONEPE_MERCHANT_KEY=SU2505141931362838820920
REACT_APP_PHONEPE_SALT_KEY=33418406-0957-4ae0-a07a-a6383760ba05
REACT_APP_PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX=1
REACT_APP_PHONEPE_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION
REACT_APP_PHONEPE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:5173/payment/callback

# Backend API URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

## ðŸ”„ Payment Status Tracking

The system now tracks these payment statuses:

- **`payment_failed`**: Payment failed, user not enrolled

## ðŸ“Š Enrollment Data Structure

```javascript
{
  courseId/workshopId: 1,
